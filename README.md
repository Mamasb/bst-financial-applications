# BST Implementation for Financial Applications

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C,
focused on its applications in financial scenarios such as maintaining order books,
managing portfolios, and optimizing trading strategies based on real-time data.

## Files

- **bst.h**: Header file containing BST structure definitions and function prototypes.
- **bst.c**: Source file containing BST function implementations.
- **main.c**: Example usage of the BST implementation with sample operations.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use the BST implementation:
1. Include `bst.h` in your C code.
2. Compile `bst.c` and `main.c` together.
3. Execute the compiled program to see the BST operations in action.

## Operations Supported

- Inserting elements into the BST.
- Deleting elements from the BST.
- Searching for elements in the BST.
- Inorder traversal to display elements in sorted order.

## Example

The `main.c` file demonstrates how to create a BST, perform operations on it, and print
the results of those operations. You can modify `main.c` to suit your specific use case
or integrate the BST functions into your own application.
